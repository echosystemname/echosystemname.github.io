I recently gave a presentation on the Double Ratchet algorithm that Signal uses for encryption at a lunch lecture series at work. I recorded the presentation and have edited it together and posted (with permission) on YouTube. Since it was a presentation at work there were several questions about how it applies to our projects, which I have edited out, though I kept the technical description generic so this video would be valuable after editing.  

Enjoy!
